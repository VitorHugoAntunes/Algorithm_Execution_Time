# Performance of algorithms

Runtime comparison of Bubble Sort and Selection Sort algorithm using JavaScript and C++ languages.


## Installation

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/VitorHugoAntunes/Algorithm_Execution_Time.git

  cd project

  npm install OR yarn
```
## Requirements to run

What you need to run the tests:

- Javascript:

  `NodeJS` and `run code`

- C++:

  `Have a C++ compiler on your machine: GCC, MinGW, MSVC, Intel C++, Clang LLVM, etc.`

  Download the <nlohmann/json.hpp> library using VCPKG and add it to your C++ compiler folder. Instructions in this [link](https://vcpkg.io/en/).

  `run code`


## Test structures

Run tests with different data structures:

- Typescript:

`Switch between JSON files from the DATA folder or change the size of the LIST variable with random numbers.`

- C++:

`Change the typing of the parameters of the BUBBLE SORT or SELECTION SORT algorithms to string or double_t (whichever you want) and choose the JSON file or the array of numbers in the function call.`
